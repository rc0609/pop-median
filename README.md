Project name: Pop Median

This program installs insert and pop median operations, using 3 abstract data types; a vector that keeps sorted, a linked list that keeps sorted, 
a max heap holding all elements <= the median and a min heap holding all elements > the median. Pop median will both return and remove the median. 
For a container with an even number of elements, the median will be the lesser of the two middle elements.
